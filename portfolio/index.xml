      <description>&lt;p&gt;CellNetVis is a web-tool for protein-protein network visualization and exploration. Its scientific article resulted in the &lt;b&gt;Best Paper Award&lt;/b&gt; offered by the BIOVIS 2017, in Prague. With this tool, biologists can explore the functional and structural mechanisms of a biological system by visualizing and exploring a biological network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the main elements that makes this tool sucessful and important are its simplicity, flexibility and design. During this project, I focused on the needs of users that usually have small networks and are not &lt;i&gt;computer experts&lt;/i&gt;. At the same time, it can handle more specific needs, such as the visualization of large networks and set up of the force directed layout.&lt;/p&gt;
